# Welcome to the Social-Media-Observatory wiki!

This wiki is the central knowledge and documentation base of the SMO. 

Please find the navigation menu on the right or below (depending on your window size/screen resolution).

## Landing Page


If you want to share this project with others, we have a [landing page](https://leibniz-hbi.github.io/SMO). We are thinking about presenting iterative versions of this wiki in a more refined layout there, but to benefit from or contribute to the latest bleeding edge version of everything, [stay awhile and listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg).

## [Data Collection Tools](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Data-Collection-Tools) and [Tutorials](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Tutorials)


So far we already have some collections of handy data collection helpers under [Data Collection Tools](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Data-Collection-Tools) and some [Tutorials](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Tutorials) how to use them.

## [Ethics / Legal](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Ethics---Legal)


We are working on and invite contributions to the [Ethics / Legal](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Ethics---Legal) section, where we plan to collect advice on common issues when working with (social) media data.

## [Knowledge Base & Case Studies](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Knowledge-Base-%26amp%3B-Case-Studies)


Also, if you have basic, but crucial, social media knowledge to share (for example overall measurement baselines for certain platforms or demographics) or examples of instructive (un)successful case studies (not necessarily your own), feel free to create the first pages in the [Knowledge Base & Case Studies](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Knowledge-Base-%26amp%3B-Case-Studies) section.

## [Datasets](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki/Datasets)


Here we curate a growing collection of useful datasets, self-collected or provided by other projects.

## I want to contribute!

Yay! Here you will find instructions how to add or edit pages:

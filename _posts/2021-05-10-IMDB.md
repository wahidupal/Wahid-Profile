# IMDB-top-grossed-and-high-ranked-movies

There was task on Kaggle regarding IMDB top 1000 movies. I have collected the data and analyzed it according to the task. 
- The dataset contained these collumns 
- PosterLink: Link of the poster that imdb using
- SeriesTitle: Name of the movie
- ReleasedYear: Year at which that movie released
- Certificate: Certificate earned by that movie
- Runtime: Total runtime of the movie
- Genre: Genre of the movie
- IMDB Rating: Rating of the movie at IMDB site
- Overview: mini story/ summary
- Meta_score: Score earned by the movie
- Director: Name of the Director
- Star1,Star2,Star3,Star4: Name of the Stars
- No of votes: Total number of votes
- Gross: Money earned by that movie

### The task was to mention the name of the movies that are getting the good rating and also able to earn good amount of money according to different genre. 
 At first I have cleaned the data according to the task as what I considered necessary. Then I reduced the dataset in terms of vote count as in I kept only those movies that has a higher vote count than 700000. I did the same thing with IMDB rating higher than 8 and movies that grossed higher than 100000000. Afterwards I put them all into bar charts according to the movie titles.
 
 These movies were sorted according to their IMDB rating and vote counts. This graph is showing the gross income of the top 10 highest rated movies.

 This graph is showing the gross income of the top 20 highest grossing movies. Unsurprisingly Avengers Endgame takes the top spot but even to my own surprise Avatar and Titanic is not on the list!

 This graph is showing the top 20 highest rated movies. Due to strict criteria I followed classics like The Shawshank Redemption is left out

### Limitations 

 This analysis has a few shortcomings due to the strict criteria that was followed. As was mentioned before the highest rated movie according to IMDB, The Shawshank Redemption has missed the cut due to it's low vote count. Same thing happened to the classics like 12 angry men, Schindler's List and a few more. It's not just the top rated movies suffers due to this. A few of the all time highest grossing movies like Avatar, Titanic, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and a few others are left out because they don't have the ratings that was desired. This data has strictly listed those movies which has both high ratings and a good amount of box office returns
